# Health-care-Data-analysis
I have successfully analyzed the healthcare dashboard, which presents key financial metrics, including billing, treatment, insurance, and procedure costs. I examined billing trends by region, diagnosis, and department, identifying insights on service types and expenses.The dashboard effectively visualizes data for better healthcare decision-making.
